                    <p id="post1"> My favorite film is waves by Trey Edward-Schultz. He is is a wicked man for creating that.
                        I almost hate him for it. It's the best thing I have ever seen and I wish that I could re-watch it
                        for the first time again. 
                    </p>
                    <p>It had such an insane impact on me. I yearn for that feeling. The only thing that has made me feel something similar is NEON GENESIS EVANGELION.
                        And that was insane huh? The real ones get it. I think about this film at least once every month. And I feel so sad and sentimental thinking about how the story went. 
                        If I could, I would live in that film. The second act only... The first act was torture. I will make a film that impacts people like Trey.

                    <p id="post1"> My favorite artist is FRANK OCEAN. I love him so much it's ridiculous. His art speaks to me in a way that nobody has in my life before. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I love evry piece of music he has released. Just kidding! There are obviously some songs 
                        that I've listened to so much that i kind of hate now. But the fact still remains. He means so much to me. 
                        I wish I could meet him in New York, and I will. This is just filler so that the text can wrap around the image. 
                        But I will say I hope Frank is doing well. He has helped me through some of the toughest times in my life though. 
                        I sound insane but, alas. Oh! And he is gorgeous.
